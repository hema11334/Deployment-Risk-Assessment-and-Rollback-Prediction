# Deployment-Risk-Assessment-and-Rollback-Prediction

This is a simple Python project that simulates a smart deployment system.

*The idea is to:
- Predict whether a software deployment might fail
- Monitor the system after deployment (error rate and CPU usage)
- Automatically "roll back" (undo changes) if something goes wrong
  
*What This Project Does

- Predicts risky deployments using a machine learning model  
- Simulates system health monitoring (like error rates and CPU usage)  
- Triggers a rollback if the system starts acting unstable
